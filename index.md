# Proof of ADA #

*Prices Go Up. Commissions Go Down*

# General Information # 

## Stake Pool Commission ##

```
0.00 - 5.00 % , based on price (USD) of ADA and total number of ADA staked
```

### How It Works ###

Staking rewards are distributed at the protocol level on the Cardano blockchain. This means staking pools must set a fixed commission fee. ***Proof of ADA*** stake pool charges a **5 \%** staking commission. However, ***Proof of ADA*** offers reduced commissions based on ADA price (USD) and the total amount of ADA staked. This means ***Proof of ADA*** stake pool refunds some or all of the stake based on the price of ADA (USD) and the total amount of staked.

### Prices go up. Commissions go down ###

Staking rewards are paid out at the protocol level on the Cardano blockchain. This means stake pools must select a static stake commission (%) in advance. While stake pools can always update their staking fees over time, ***Proof of ADA*** presents a price- and stake-dependent model for reducing stake fees as ADA increases in price. Staking with ***Proof of ADA*** offers an automated commission reduction schedule that users know before staking with ***Proof of ADA***.

## Everyone's a Whale ## 

### What if I'm Not a Whale? ###

Good. 

***Proof of ADA*** will treat you like one. 

For any wallet with less than 100,000.00 ADA staked, the wallet receives the same commission reduction schedule as a wallet with 100,000.00 ADA. ***Proof of ADA*** hopes this will have the effect of attracting many smaller wallets rather than a few larger wallets.

*example: A wallet stakes 5,000.00 to the **Proof of ADA** stake pool. **Proof of ADA** stake pool assigns a value of 100,000.00 ADA to the commission reduction function for that wallet.*

### What if I'm a Whale? ###

Good. 

***Proof of ADA*** will treat you like one.

Zero commission staking is available to larger wallets. Depending on the size of the stake, larger wallets quickly approach zero commissions for staking based on the ***Proof of ADA*** staking model. 

*example: A wallet stakes 10,000,000.00 to the **Proof of ADA** stake pool. **Proof of ADA** stake pool will indefinitely offer commissionless staking for ADA prices above 0.75 USD.*

# Node SysOps #

## Firewalls and Encryption ##

While the staking reward distributions on the Cardano blockchain occur at the protocol level, ***Proof of ADA*** assumes temporary custody of some users' staking rewards to be given back. As such, ***Proof of ADA*** nodes are highly secure to prevent fraudulent activity at the node level.

## Automated Health Status Checks ##

Nodes can crash; things happen. Without properly timed automated health status checks, nodes can crash and remain crashed indefinitely. Crashed nodes will lose sync with the Cardano blockchain and will therefore not be able to generate new blocks. Nodes are compensated for producing new blocks. If a node is crashed and cannot produce a new block, no staking rewards are paid to the node. ***Proof of ADA*** Nodes perform timely health status checks constantly to identify and rectify failures as quickly as possible. 

## Automated Software Release Pulls ## 

IOHK will continue to improve the Cardano blockchain over time. Nodes wanting to stay up to date on the latest software release will need to be able to know a new software release is available, download the updates, compile the updates, and begin running the new software release. In certain cases, software upgrades may be required for a node to continue to be in compliance with the network constraints concerning eligibility to produce the next block. Nodes that do not upgrade the software in these cases are likely relegated to a status that does not allow them to produce new blocks and earn rewards. ***Proof of ADA*** Nodes regularly ping the software repositories looking for new software releases. 

## Server Redundancy ##

Cloud service providers can experience temporary site-specific failures. Creating a fallback (redundant) server deployment process guarantees site-specific failures will not affect system performance. ***Proof of ADA*** Nodes have backup server deployment functionality so the node remains to run, even when the host site goes down.

# Who We Are #

## Cardano Community Members Since Early 2017 ##

The ***Proof of ADA*** team is made up of two engineers. Our professional experience in software engineering and cryptocurrency gives us the ability to deliver professional stake pool management from the perspective of the average crypto investor.


*While the risks associated with stake pool management on the Cardano blockchain are relatively minimal, and risks can be mitigated near-instantly, ***Proof of ADA*** does not disclose the identity of the stake pool managers.*
